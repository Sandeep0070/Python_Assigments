    "Variable names cannot start with a number.\n",
    "Variable names are case-sensitive, so myVar and myvar are different variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Whitespace:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names cannot contain spaces. Use underscores to separate words in a variable name if needed (e.g., my_variable).\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### 1. Descriptive Names:\n",
    "Choose meaningful and descriptive names for your variables. A variable name should convey the purpose or content of the variable. For example: Instead of x, use num_entries if the variable represents the number of entries.\n",
    "#### 2. Avoid Single-Character Names (in most cases):\n",
    "Single-character variable names (like i, j, k for loop counters) are acceptable in certain contexts, but it's generally better to use more descriptive names. For example: index instead of i.\n",
    "#### 3. Use English Words:\n",
    "Stick to English words for variable names and comments. This helps maintain consistency in your codebase.\n",
    "#### 4. Constants:\n",
    "Constants (values that don't change) should be named with all uppercase letters and underscores. For example: MAX_VALUE, PI.\n",
    "#### 5.Class Names:\n",
    "Class names should follow the CapWords (or CamelCase) convention, where each word's first letter is capitalized. For example: MyClass, CarModel.\n",
    "#### 6.Function Names:\n",
    "Function names should be lowercase with words separated by underscores. For example: calculate_total(), process_data().\n",
    "#### 7.Module Names:\n",
    "Module names should be lowercase and short. Avoid underscores in module names unless necessary for readability. For example: my_module.py, utils.py.\n",
    "#### 8.Private Variables:\n",
    "Variables intended for internal use within a class or module should start with a single underscore. For example: _internal_var.\n",
    "Avoid Shadowing Built-in Names:\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid using names that are too similar to Python built-in names or commonly used modules to prevent unintentional shadowing."
